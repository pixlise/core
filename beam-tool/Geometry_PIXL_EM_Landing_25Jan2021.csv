comment, X-ray beam line location, MCC camera model, and SLI beam positions all from PIXL EM Geometric Calibration   June 2020
comment,     using X-ray beam location target features coordinates from new CMM, 10/24/2019, 6:19 PM
comment,     Metrology data adjusted to new post-LVCM-rework coordinate system (Larry Wade, Jan. 2020) PIXL Coordinates-Synthesisrev5b.xlsx
comment, Drift model selection added Jan. 20, 2021     Use TIME for EM for test data (try using Arm Resistance for FM to start)
comment, SDD positions added Jan. 20, 2021     to use in calculation standoff corrections (positions are from the CAD dawing above)

comment,  *** Everything converted to meters and using CAHVOR model refined by Todd Litwin (Gennery) code (works near perfect!) ***
